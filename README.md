# Week 1: Initial thoughts + research as narrative

**Date:** 1/15/2026
**Phase:** Journalist 
**Approach Used:** The Connector


I must admit, I’ve never been very good with computer stuff. The most I know about file management is organizing Pokémon in the PC box on the DS. I took two coding classes as an undecided freshman, and I can’t say I learned a single thing. It’s always seemed too daunting to me. In all of these classes, there was an expectation that I had done this before, even in an introductory-level class. Even in data management, a class designed for Mass Comm students, I often found myself lost. That being said, I’m optimistic about this class and hope that I’ll be able to handle what is to come.

  

I appreciate that, though indirectly, some of my concerns were acknowledged in class, that we’re mass comm people, and we likely chose this route in part due to a lack of math or science skills. Furthermore, I appreciated tying research to narratives. I’ve never heard such a comparison before, and I feel that framing will help me better understand data research, or at least make it more tolerable. The idea that just as a compelling character must challenge their beliefs, a researcher must work to disprove their hypothesis really intrigued me. The idea that the universe’s sacred flaw is that nothing matters, everything is random, and that researchers exist to stand against that makes them seem almost like heroes standing against an uncaring, nihilistic, overwhelming force of evil. This immediately makes me more excited to do my own research. It frames it as something that matters, and not just boring, insignificant work I'll have to do to potentially make money in the future.
