# Week 1: Initial thoughts + research as narrative

I must admit, I’ve never been very good with computer stuff. The most I know about file management is organizing Pokémon in the PC box on the DS. I took two coding classes as an undecided freshman, and I can’t say I learned a single thing. It’s always seemed too daunting to me. In all of these classes, there was an expectation that I had done this before, even in an introductory-level class. Even in data management, a class designed for Mass Comm students, I often found myself lost. That being said, I’m optimistic about this class and hope that I’ll be able to handle what is to come.

  

I appreciate that, though indirectly, some of my concerns were acknowledged in class, that we’re mass comm people, and we likely chose this route in part due to a lack of math or science skills. Furthermore, I appreciated tying research to narratives. I’ve never heard such a comparison before, and I feel that framing will help me better understand data research, or at least make it more tolerable. The idea that just as a compelling character must challenge their beliefs, a researcher must work to disprove their hypothesis really intrigued me. The idea that the universe’s sacred flaw is that nothing matters, everything is random, and that researchers exist to stand against that makes them seem almost like heroes standing against an uncaring, nihilistic, overwhelming force of evil. This immediately makes me more excited to do my own research. It frames it as something that matters, and not just boring, insignificant work I'll have to do to potentially make money in the future.

# Week 2: Connecting Nonverbal Concepts to Research Reproducability

In conjunction with this class, I am taking ACS 434, Nonverbal Communication. While that class and this one don’t have much overlap on the surface, today we went on a tangent that I think ties in nicely with this week’s material. Most of our class period focused on error, specifically within research. The idea is that human beings are flawed, and nothing we do will ever be perfect.

When studying facial expressions, for example, it’s difficult to quantify what exactly counts as a smile and where to draw the line between a smile and a straight face. Eventually, you’ll encounter expressions that fall somewhere in between and be forced to make a judgment call.

In medicine, when diagnosing a patient, you’re taught to err on the side of caution. A false positive is better than a false negative. It’s better for someone to think they have cancer and not have it than to think they don’t and actually do. With SNAP benefits, however, the issue becomes more complicated. Where do you draw the line, and how wide should the door be? Is it better for a small number of undeserving people to receive taxpayer money, or are we willing to let people go hungry in order to ensure no one receives benefits they “shouldn’t”?

I think this ties directly into the problem of reproducing research. In many cases, it’s difficult to draw a clear line between one category and another. If too many false positives are included, it can distort the results, and two different researchers can look at the same data and walk away with entirely different conclusions. This goes to show how much interpretation and human error can shape research outcomes, even when the goal is objectivity.
